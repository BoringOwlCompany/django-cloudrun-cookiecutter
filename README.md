# CookieCutter Template for a CloudRun Django project

A [Cookie Cutter Template](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for
creating a public python package.

This template is heavily inspired by [https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/django-demo-app-unicodex](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/django-demo-app-unicodex), which we've then optimised for our use case.



## Usage:

First, install `cookiecutter`:

`pip install cookiecutter`

Next, generate a project directory:

`cookiecutter https://github.com/kogan/django-cloudrun-cookiecutter`

Now go forth and continue editing your new project.
